  Delegate a coding or agentic task to claude-ds — a DeepSeek-backed Claude Code
  CLI — as a worker. Use to run/delegate work via claude-ds or DeepSeek. Covers
  invocation (generation vs full-agentic), running as a background task, isolating
  real-repo work in a git worktree, and review/verify/merge of the output. The
  built-in Agent/subagent tool canNOT use DeepSeek (model enum is Anthropic-only) —
  claude-ds is the only path.
  This is a DeepSeek-only fork of cli-dispatch (see FORK-NOTES.md): the Antigravity/Gemini,
  Codex, OpenCode and Copilot backends have been removed. DeepSeek is the ONLY worker
  here. Do NOT reach for any other backend (Codex/OpenAI, OpenCode/OpenRouter, GitHub
  Copilot, Gemini/Antigravity, or any Google model) — none of them exist in this setup.

# claude-ds — DeepSeek delegation worker

`claude-ds` is a portable wrapper installed to `~/.local/bin` by `/cli-dispatch:setup`;
it runs the Claude Code CLI against DeepSeek's Anthropic-compatible API. Since it's on
PATH, call it **directly as `claude-ds`** (no old `zsh -ic` function trick needed).

> **DeepSeek-only fork.** This install delegates to **DeepSeek only** (`claude-ds`). The
> upstream cli-dispatch also shipped Antigravity/Gemini, Codex/OpenAI, OpenCode/OpenRouter
> and GitHub Copilot backends — all removed here. Never invoke `ag-agent` / `cx-agent` /
> `oc-agent` / `cp-agent` — they do not exist in this setup.

## When / when not
- The built-in `Agent`/subagent tool does **NOT support** DeepSeek (`model` enum: sonnet/opus/haiku/fable).
  This is the only way to hand work to DeepSeek.
- Conversation context is **not shared** → the prompt must be **self-contained**.

## Models
DeepSeek exposes exactly two models — use them with confidence:
- **`deepseek-v4-pro`** — the workhorse (code, refactors, agentic repo work). This is `DS_MODEL`.
- **`deepseek-flash`** — the fast/cheap model for simple, high-volume, low-stakes calls. This is `DS_FLASH_MODEL`.

Override per call with `--model deepseek-v4-pro` / `--model deepseek-flash`, or set `DS_MODEL`
in `~/.config/cli-dispatch/config`.

## Wrappers
- **`ds-agent`** (SIMPLEST — subagent-style) — one synchronous command: give it a task, it
  runs to completion, streams tool activity to stderr, and prints **only the final answer to
  stdout**. Default agentic (may write/run in `--cwd`); `--read-only` for analysis-only.
  Best when you just want "delegate this and give me the result" in a single call.
- **`claude-ds-stream`** — runs `claude` with stream-json, parses output into a **session
  directory** (live + observable + resumable). Use when you want to run in the background and
  poll, or need the session id / `--resume` / `/cli-dispatch:watch` workflow.
- **`claude-ds`** — plain env wrapper (`claude "$@"`). No parsing/session; fast one-shot only.

### ds-agent — single command (subagent-style)
```bash
ds-agent "<task>"                     # agentic in cwd; live progress on stderr; answer on stdout
ds-agent --read-only "<question>"     # no writes / no bash
ds-agent --cwd <dir> "<task>"         # work in <dir> (use an isolated dir for safety)
ds-agent --resume <id> "<follow-up>"  # continue a session
echo "<task>" | ds-agent              # task via stdin
```
stdout = final answer only (safe to capture/pipe); stderr = banner + live tool activity.
Exit code is the worker's. `-q` silences the banner/progress. It forwards
`--max-runtime`/`--idle-timeout` to the underlying `claude-ds-stream`.

Session directory: `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/cli-dispatch/sessions/<id>/` (legacy `claude-ds` path still read as a fallback)
- `status.json` — compact rolling summary (**the only file to poll**: state, lastTool, toolCounts, finalResultPreview)
- `progress.log` — terse human-readable stream (`▸ Edit foo.ts`, `✓/✗`, truncated text)
- `transcript.jsonl` — raw stream-json (resume/audit; **NOT read while polling**)
- `meta.json` — prompt preview, cwd, branch, model, start/end

## The deterministic runner (`/cli-dispatch:run`) — no LLM babysitter
There is no `ds-runner` subagent anymore — running/monitoring/isolating/verifying a DeepSeek
delegation inside its own LLM sub-context measured at ~9x the worker's own output in Anthropic
tokens for zero quality gain, which defeated the point of delegating at all (issue #114). For
mechanical work with a machine-checkable verify command, route it through the deterministic
runner instead:
```
/cli-dispatch:run ds "<self-contained task>" --verify '<cmd>'
```
`cli-dispatch-run` launches DeepSeek, isolates repo work in a git worktree, blocks until it
finishes (or times out), runs `--verify`, and prints a compact verdict — zero LLM tokens spent
on orchestration. The only backend is `ds`.

**Escalation path** (judgment-heavy work, no verify command): call `ds-agent` directly (or
still go through `/cli-dispatch:run` without `--verify`), then read the compact result and the
diff yourself, following up with `/cli-dispatch:resume <session-id> "<prompt>"` if it needs
another pass. For a quick one-shot with no repo changes, `ds-agent` alone is enough.

## Run rules
- **Always run as a background task**: Bash tool `run_in_background: true` (don't block).
- For a **long prompt**, write the brief to a file and pass it with `-p "$(cat <brieffile>)"`.
- **Cost-conscious monitoring (MANDATORY):** track progress by reading only the small `status.json`
  (`/cli-dispatch:watch <id>`). Don't read the raw `transcript.jsonl`; don't tail it repeatedly in a
  tight loop; check once per orchestration step. When the task finishes you get re-invoked anyway.
- **Windows:** after setup, `claude-ds` / `claude-ds-stream` are called directly (`.cmd` shim);
  the parser `.mjs` is shared cross-platform. On macOS/Linux/WSL the `.sh` variants apply.

> **Not a sandbox by default.** The wrapper always runs with `--permission-mode
> bypassPermissions` (the CLI can't prompt in non-interactive `--print` mode), so the
> worker **can write files and run bash even without `--dangerously-skip-permissions`**.
> "Generation mode" is a convention (you didn't give it a file task), not an enforced
> sandbox. For real-repo tasks, isolate in a worktree. For guaranteed no-writes, use `--read-only`.

### Mode 1 — Generation (code/text/analysis)
```bash
claude-ds-stream -p "<self-contained prompt>"
```
The final text goes to stdout, progress goes to the session directory. Session id on stderr.
The worker *can* still write files if the prompt leads it to — add `--read-only` to forbid that.

### Mode 1-safe — True read-only (denies Write/Edit/Bash; nothing mutated)
```bash
claude-ds-stream --read-only -p "<analysis/generation prompt>"
```
Use when the output must be text-only and the worker must not touch disk.

### Mode 2 — Full agentic (writes files + runs bash)
```bash
claude-ds-stream --cwd <dir> --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "$(cat /tmp/ds-brief.txt)"
```
Writes files / runs bash → **you MUST isolate it** (worktree). (`--dangerously-skip-permissions`
is largely redundant with the default bypassPermissions; it signals intent and matches the worktree helper.)

### Follow-up / resume (continue the same DeepSeek session)
```bash
claude-ds-stream --resume <session-id> -p "<follow-up>"
```
The transcript is appended to the same session; `status.json` is updated. See sessions: `/cli-dispatch:sessions`.

### Timeouts (safety net for hung/runaway workers)
```bash
claude-ds-stream --max-runtime 600 --idle-timeout 90 -p "<prompt>"   # seconds; 0 = off (default)
```
A background watchdog kills the worker (and its child processes) if it exceeds the overall
runtime cap (`--max-runtime`) or stalls with no new output (`--idle-timeout`, measured from
`transcript.jsonl` activity). Timed-out sessions are marked `state: error` with
`error: "timeout: …"`. Env fallbacks: `CLAUDE_DS_MAX_RUNTIME`, `CLAUDE_DS_IDLE_TIMEOUT`.
Both default off. Enforced on both wrappers — bash via a `kill_tree` watchdog, PowerShell
via a background-job watchdog that locates the worker by its session id and kills the tree
with `taskkill /T /F`.

## Safe operation for a real repo task (MANDATORY)
Use the bundled helper:
```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/ds-worktree-run.sh" <repo> <branch> <brief-file>
```
This script: opens an isolated git worktree (origin/main), symlinks `node_modules` if present,
runs **claude-ds-stream** in Mode 2 inside the worktree (session-tracked), and leaves the diff
**UNCOMMITTED**. The session id is printed on stderr → watch it with `/cli-dispatch:watch <id>`.

Then **YOU are the reviewer:**
1. Review the FULL diff with `git -C <worktree> status && git -C <worktree> diff` — check for
   side effects, confirm only the target files were touched.
2. Run tsc/build/test **yourself** (independent verification).
3. If all good, YOU do the git: commit → push → PR → merge → `git pull origin main` on the main checkout.
   Note in the commit body that "implementation was delegated to claude-ds (DeepSeek)" (transparency).
4. Cleanup: `rm <worktree>/node_modules` → `git worktree remove <worktree> --force` → `git worktree prune`.

## Triviality gate

Before delegating, ask three questions: (1) single file? (2) expected diff under
~50 lines? (3) zero discovery/ambiguity — you could write the exact edit right
now? If all three are yes, do NOT delegate — do it inline; the delegation's
fixed cost (worker spin-up + isolation + your own merge/verify cycle) exceeds
the work. If several such trivial fixes accumulate, batch them into one
delegation instead (see "Batch small fixes" below).

## Batch small fixes

When the orchestrator sees a delegation prompt with several small related fixes
(expected ~50 lines per fix, fixes are related), combine them into a SINGLE
delegation with an itemized checklist rather than multiple delegations. The
economics favor one worker, one diff, one verify cycle — per-delegation fixed
costs (worker spin-up + orchestrator merge/verify) dominate for
small changes, so splitting them across separate delegations multiplies that
overhead for no benefit.

## Role
The worker (claude-ds = DeepSeek) does the work; you = orchestrator + reviewer +
git/merge owner. Don't trust any output until verified.

## Commands
- `/cli-dispatch:setup` — install & configure the DeepSeek worker backend + config + smoke test.
- `/cli-dispatch:dashboard` — open the local read-only web dashboard (Claude Code sessions → flow → subagents → flow, + a cli-dispatch worker panel).
- `/cli-dispatch:ds-run <task>` — delegate to the **DeepSeek** worker (worktree isolation for repo tasks, session-tracked).
- `/cli-dispatch:run ds "<task>" --verify '<cmd>'` — the deterministic runner: launch + worktree-isolate + block + verify, zero LLM babysitter tokens. The primary way to delegate mechanical work.
- `/cli-dispatch:sessions` — list past/active DeepSeek sessions. Also `ds-sessions`.
- `/cli-dispatch:watch <id>` — show a session's compact live status (cost-conscious).
- `/cli-dispatch:wait <id>` — block until a session reaches a terminal state (or times out), then print a compact summary; one blocking call instead of polling `watch`.
- `/cli-dispatch:resume <id> <prompt>` — continue a worker session with a follow-up prompt.
- `/cli-dispatch:kill <id>` — stop a running worker session (SIGTERM + state → killed).
- `/cli-dispatch:clean` — remove stale worker dirs (a `running` session whose process died before finalize, so `status.json` is stuck). Dry-run by default; `--remove` deletes, `--older-than DAYS` also prunes old finished sessions.
- `/cli-dispatch:clean-schedule` — register a daily OS-level auto-clean (launchd/cron/Scheduled Tasks) that runs `cli-dispatch-clean --remove` in the background; `status` / `uninstall` actions too.
- `/cli-dispatch:status` — check installation/key/CLI status for the DeepSeek backend. Also `ds-status`.
- `/cli-dispatch:balance` / `/cli-dispatch:ds-balance` — show the DeepSeek account balance.
- `/cli-dispatch:gain` — worker token totals.
- `/cli-dispatch:doctor` — health check (PATH, keys, CLI auth ✓/✗).
- `/cli-dispatch:help` — one-screen command reference.
