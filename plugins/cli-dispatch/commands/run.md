# Run cli-dispatch worker: $ARGUMENTS

Launch a worker via `cli-dispatch-run` (the deterministic no-LLM runner from 3.34.0)
and print a compact verdict summary — no babysitter, zero LLM tokens spent on orchestration.
Best for mechanical delegations with a machine-checkable `--verify` command.

```bash
# $ARGUMENTS is substituted TEXTUALLY into this script before bash parses it, so the
# user's quoting survives as real shell quoting — do NOT wrap this in eval (nested
# double quotes would split the prompt). Verified with a stub-binary harness.
set -- $ARGUMENTS

Exit codes: `0` success (verify passed or no verify requested); non-zero (`2`–`5`) = launch /
timeout / verify / worker failure — `verdict.json` carries details.

- Deterministic runner — zero LLM babysitter tokens; use for mechanical delegations with a
  machine-checkable verify command.
- Continue afterwards: `/cli-dispatch:resume <session-id> "<follow-up>"` (auto-detects backend).

## Working directory

`--cwd` is normally a main checkout, and the runner isolates the work in a fresh
`/tmp/<backend>-wt-*` worktree. **If `--cwd` is itself a linked git worktree, the runner
runs the worker in it directly** (in-place mode, 3.44.0) — no nested worktree, no cleanup,
and nothing in that directory is ever removed by the runner. The leak post-check then
guards the *main* checkout instead. Force the legacy nested behaviour with
`CLI_DISPATCH_NO_IN_PLACE=1`.

## Writing a good `--verify`

The worker's own "tests passed / lint clean" claims are **not** a gate — only the
`--verify` chain's exit code is (every brief now carries a working-directory contract
saying so). Pick commands that fail loudly on the failure mode you actually fear:

- Python move/refactor: add `ruff check --select F821 <target>` — moving function bodies
  and pruning module imports fail *independently*, and F821 catches the pruned-import
  class in a second even when the full test run is slow.
- JS/TS: a type-check (`tsc --noEmit`) alongside the test command, for the same reason.
- Anything: make the last verify step an import/collection smoke test — a package that
  does not import cannot be "green".
